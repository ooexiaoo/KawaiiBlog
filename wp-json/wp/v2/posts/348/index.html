If you&#8217;ve felt overwhelmed by your to-do list or found yourself in the constant loop of procrastination, worry not &#8211; I&#8217;m here to explain how you can use Pomodoro technique to help you get things in order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the Deal with Pomodoro?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is Pomodoro? Pomodoro is a time management method develop by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The core idea of Pomodoro is, break your work into short, focused intervals, also known as <strong>&#8220;Pomodoros,&#8221;<\/strong> with some breaks in between.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this keeps you fresh and focused for longer periods of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Set Up Your Pomodoro Station<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get started, we need to set up the right space for success.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540-1024x576.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540-1024x576.webp 1024w, https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540-300x169.webp 300w, https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540-768x432.webp 768w, https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540-1536x864.webp 1536w, https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153540.webp 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Find a timer, like the one on our site.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a designated distraction free zone.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get a water bottle, or something to keep you hydrated.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Make sure you have all the work related material at hand, You don&#8217;t wanna get up multiple times, which can lead to distractions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now it&#8217;s time to focus!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breaking Down the Pomodoro Technique<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re prepped, let&#8217;s see the anatomy of a Pomodoro session.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The steps are simple &#8211;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a task<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set your timer for 25 minutes, and dive in.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one pomodoro down!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Once the timer beeps, take a short break.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rinse and repeat.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After four pomodoros, reward yourself with a more extended break.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple, right? When you get the hang of it, it feels almost second nature to follow the Pomodoro timer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tackling Distractions and Procrastination<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Distractions can be sneaky ninjas that can destroy your productivity without you even understanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things that you need to be careful of when doing your Pomodoro sessions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Turn off notifications.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Close Irrelevant tabs. It&#8217;s easy to get distracted if you accidentally open it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work in a place that isn&#8217;t noisy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Try not to listen to distracting music while working. This depends on the kind of work you&#8217;re doing.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adapting Pomodoro to Your Workflow<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pomodoro isn&#8217;t a one-size-fits-all technique. You need to pick what works for you! Think of it like a productivity buffet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How you can do that? Adjust the length of your Pomodoro length based on the task at hand and your energy levels. Some people really love the classic <strong>25\/5 split<\/strong>, while others find the <strong>45\/15 splits<\/strong> more useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that the kind of splits you do also depends on what you&#8217;re working on. For me, I love the 45\/15 splits when I&#8217;m coding, but then I enjoy 25\/5 splits when I&#8217;m writing something. You need to experiment and find what works for you. This can take some time to figure out, but it&#8217;s not that hard.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"435\" height=\"466\" src=\"https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153647.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153647.webp 435w, https:\/\/dev-clientdev.pantheonsite.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Screenshot_20240129_153647-280x300.webp 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overcoming Pomodoro Challenges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When trying any new thing, it&#8217;s possible that you&#8217;d struggle with the Pomodoro technique at first.
