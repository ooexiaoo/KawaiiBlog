Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who we share your data with<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"privacy-policy-tutorial\">Suggested text: <\/strong>If you request a password reset, your IP address will be included in the reset email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How long we retain your data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong class=\"privacy-policy-tutorial\">Suggested text: <\/strong>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely.

All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).
